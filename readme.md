## Geometry

#### Primitives
  * Distance between two points

  * Midpoint of a line

  * Given two lines, L1 and L2, find their intersection
    Solve => kx + c = mx + b

  * Given a line L and a point P, determine whether p
    is above or below L, evaluate function at x, test if p_y is
    greater or less than l_y

  * Given three points p1, p2, p3, we traverse the three points determine
    whether we make a left or a right turn at p2

  * Given a triangle abc and a point p, determine whether p is in abc or not.

  * Given a triangle abc, compute its area

  * Given three points, a,b,c find the center of the circle through abc

  * Given a simple polygon, p of n vertices and a point q, determine whether q
  is inside p
